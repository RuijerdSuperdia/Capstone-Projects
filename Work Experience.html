    <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>After completing my higher secondary education, I gained practical experience by working at my uncle's hardware repair and sales shop for a month. This opportunity allowed me to delve into various aspects of computer hardware, software implementation, as well as the intricate processes of assembling and disassembling computer parts. The hands-on experience provided me with valuable insights and enhanced my knowledge in these areas.<br/>
        <br/>
        Subsequently, during the recruitment process for a club at Amrita College, I undertook the task of learning HTML, CSS, and various other new concepts. This experience proved to be a transformative journey, providing me with a fresh perspective on the world of web development. The process not only allowed me to acquire new skills but also deepened my understanding of the intricate details involved in creating and designing websites.<br/>
        <br/>
        This unique blend of academic knowledge and practical experience has significantly enriched my skill set. I am now even more motivated to explore further challenges and advancements within the realm of Computer Science and web development.<br/>
