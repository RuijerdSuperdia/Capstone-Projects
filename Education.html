    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>I successfully completed my secondary education at CMI Public School, Chalakudy, where I achieved an outstanding score of 96 percent. This period not only provided me with a strong academic foundation but also instilled in me a passion for learning and academic excellence.
        I consider myself a hardworking and enthusiastic individual, dedicated to honing my skills in the field. I am passionate about exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge. Web development has captured my interest, and I am excited about the projects I am currently working on.<br/>
        <br/>

        Building upon this foundation, I continued my educational journey at St. Antony's Public School, Kanijarapally, for my higher secondary education. During this phase, I dedicated myself to my studies and extracurricular activities, resulting in a commendable score of 92 percent. This experience further shaped my understanding of various subjects and equipped me with valuable skills for my future endeavors.<br/>
        <br/>
        Presently, I am immersed in the dynamic field of Computer Science as I pursue my B.Tech at Amrita College in Kollam. The curriculum, coupled with practical projects and hands-on experiences, has deepened my knowledge and passion for the fascinating world of technology. I am particularly drawn to the challenges and innovations within the realm of web development, where I have been actively involved in several projects, applying and expanding my skills.<br/>
        <br/>
        The diverse academic journey, from Chalakudy to Kanijarapally and now at Amrita College, has not only enriched my educational background but has also honed my ability to adapt to new environments and challenges. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am committed to furthering my knowledge and contributing meaningfully to the field of Computer Science.<br/>
